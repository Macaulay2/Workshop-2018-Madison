Done:

- export SpaceCurves before Polyhedra so Polyhedra$isSmooth is not shadowed
- renamed findGensUpToIrrelevance â†’ idealSheafGens
- virtualOfPair gets a Strategy option
- added documentation for virtualOfPair strategy
- fixed virtualOfPair (only checks if chain complex is a virtual resolution now not of what)


TODO:
- ask Mike why we need idealSheafGens and why does it output like that. Can we change it?
- ask Mike and Christine about restating theorems?
- benchmark virtualOfPair?
